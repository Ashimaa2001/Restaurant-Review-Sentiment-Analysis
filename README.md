# Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis

This project aims to analyze restaurant reviews and predict whether they are positive or negative using different machine learning models. The models utilized in this project are:

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Bernoulli Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
The accuracy, precision, and recall metrics are calculated for each model and are then compared to determine the most effective one for this sentiment analysis task.

Models Used
1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It has been applied to this project to classify restaurant reviews into positive or negative sentiments.

2. Multinomial Naive Bayes
Multinomial Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on the Bayes theorem. It is commonly used for text classification tasks and has been incorporated into this project for sentiment analysis.

3. Bernoulli Naive Bayes
Bernoulli Naive Bayes is another variant of the Naive Bayes algorithm that is suitable for binary feature data. It has been employed in this project to perform sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews.

4. Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a linear classifier that is widely used for binary classification problems. It has been implemented in this project to predict the sentiment of restaurant reviews.

Results
After training the models on the provided dataset, the following results were obtained:

Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Accuracy: 77.22%
Precision: 80.2%
Recall: 79.41%
Using Multinomial Naive Bayes

Accuracy: 78.89%
Precision: 81.37%
Recall: 81.37%
Using Bernoulli Naive Bayes

Accuracy: 76.11%
Precision: 75.21%
Recall: 86.27%
Using Logistic Regression

Accuracy: 77.78%
Precision: 78.7%
Recall: 83.33%
The results demonstrate that the Multinomial Naive Bayes model achieved the highest accuracy and precision among the four models. However, depending on specific use cases, other models may be more suitable.
